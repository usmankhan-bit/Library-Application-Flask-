            I have read some 4-5 papers and found about string similarity. I had read through some string similarity
            algorithms. I felt Ratcliff-Obershelp algorithm is something which can help find similarity. I compared the
            result with the existing model which separates the adjectives from the description of the objects, finds the
            common words and then calculates similarity. The results were the same.Sir, Should I continue with this
            similarity measure or have to find an alternative way to compute similarity ? Also as u said sir, I created
            generic descriptions of some objects consider chair here as object and I’m able to tweak them according to
            the
            user like for colour but there are also other parameters in which the object differs like the type of
            material
            used, its weight is it light or heavy. User might say black chair or red chair but he cannot specify in the
            input like is it heavy or material used. If I consider this then I need to create some general properties of
            each object and take them from user as input. Now how should I proceed further sir and also please suggest
            me as
            what should my literature survey should contain.
